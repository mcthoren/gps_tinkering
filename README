USB GPS receivers are becoming cheap enough to stick on a raspberry pi and screw with just for fun. So that's what this code is about.

more specifically, for ham radio antenna reasons, i'm interested in a reasonably accurate measure of my elevation. so for a start i'm going to collect those statistics, plot the long term averages, and see if they tell me anything.

this code uses the gpsd tools, and python client libraries.
running:
	apt-get install python-gps gpsd-clients

should get one off to a good start.
